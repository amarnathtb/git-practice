I resigned in oracle in July last year. I wanted to 1) restart my career in IT infrastructure domain in the management role on latest technologies, 2) do higher education 3) Upgrade my skills. I have enrolled into EPGDM course a part time MBA course and attended 1st term, Also "AWS devops architect" and "Bigdata Hadoop solutions Architect" courses.

Tried the internal jobs in oracle but could not succeed. less openings and skill mismatch.

I learned a lot in oracle handling key IT SCM projects. I have gone there as far as i can go there. In the last 3-4 years, i performed a role in Build / Release management. It was a routine job and no further scope for my skills. I could manage to stay for almost 3 years due to various family issues one after another. 

My dad had a cancer disease, diagnosed in Advanced stage. I am being the only son of my parent, i needed to take care of him because they were living in madurai and i am living in bangalore. I lost him during this period. Also my mom was also not stable after this,she has obesity eg: obesity/sugar complaint,

Moreover after 24 years of non-stop work in my career, i was feeling exhausted so i decided to take a break and spend time with family and upgrade my skills and continue higher education.

I am keen on taking up the new job. In the last couple of months i am actively looking for the jobs.
